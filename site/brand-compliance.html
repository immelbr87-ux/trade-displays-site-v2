  <h2>Why this exists</h2>
  <p>Showrooms often sell floor models and clearance items. This page clarifies how to do that in a brand-safe, professional way during the pilot.</p>
</section>

<section class="panel">
  <h2>Default guidelines (recommended)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <b>as-is</b> language consistently.</li>
    <li>Do not imply manufacturer warranty unless explicitly confirmed for that item.</li>
    <li>Avoid using brand logos in listing photos unless they’re naturally part of the product.</li>
    <li>Describe condition with observable facts (scratches, missing trim) rather than opinions.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="panel">
  <h2>Safe listing language (copy/paste)</h2>
  <div class="card" style="padding:16px;">
    <p style="margin-top:0;"><b>Condition note:</b> “This is a showroom display item sold as-is. Buyer will inspect at pickup prior to acceptance. Normal display wear may be present as disclosed in photos and notes.”</p>
    <p><b>Warranty note:</b> “Manufacturer warranty is not guaranteed for display/clearance items unless explicitly stated by the showroom.”</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><b>Pickup note:</b> “Pickup-only. Buyer is responsible for transport and any required equipment/labor.”</p>
