      <h1 style="margin-top:10px;">Terms (Pilot Preview)</h1>
      <p class="lede" style="max-width:900px;">This is a plain-language summary for the pilot site. It is not legal advice and may be replaced by a signable agreement for participating showrooms.</p>

      <h2>Core rules</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Pickup-only:</strong> No shipping, freight, or delivery is arranged through Trade Displays.</li>
        <li><strong>As-is:</strong> Floor models are sold as-is. Cosmetic wear is expected and disclosed via Grade A / Grade B.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspection at pickup:</strong> Buyer inspects on-site before accepting.</li>
        <li><strong>Escrow release:</strong> Funds release only after buyer acceptance at pickup.</li>
        <li><strong>No post-pickup disputes:</strong> Once accepted and removed from site, the transaction is final.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Mismatch handling</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin-top:0;">If the item materially differs from the listing (wrong model/specs, undisclosed damage beyond the stated grade, missing critical components disclosed as “included”), the buyer can decline acceptance on-site and escrow does not release. The seller may relist with corrected details.</p>

      <h2>Brand safety</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin-top:0;">Listings must be factual, specs-first, and avoid warranty or performance claims. Marketing language should not imply manufacturer endorsement.</p>
