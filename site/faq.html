  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <details open>
    <summary><b>What is Trade Displays?</b></summary>
    <p>Trade Displays is a pickup-only listing and transaction flow designed for showrooms to move floor models and clearance items with clear buyer expectations. Buyers inspect at pickup and confirm acceptance before funds are released.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Is this a marketplace with delivery?</b></summary>
    <p>No. Trade Displays is pickup-only. We do not coordinate shipping or delivery.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Who is it for?</b></summary>
    <p>Showroom teams that occasionally remove or replace displays (vanities, faucets, toilets, fixtures) and want a clean, documented way to sell them as-is without post-pickup disputes.</p>
  </details>

  <h2>Pickup, inspection, and payment</h2>
  <details open>
    <summary><b>When does the buyer pay?</b></summary>
    <p>At reservation. Funds are held until pickup is completed and the buyer confirms the item matches the listing.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>What happens at pickup?</b></summary>
    <p>The buyer inspects the item on-site. If it matches the listing, the buyer confirms acceptance and funds are released.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>What if the item doesn’t match the listing?</b></summary>
    <p>The buyer can decline acceptance at pickup. In that case, the transaction is cancelled and funds are not released.</p>
  </details>
</section>

<section class="panel">
  <h2>Condition and disputes</h2>
  <details open>
    <summary><b>What do Grade A and Grade B mean?</b></summary>
    <p><b>Grade A</b> is showroom-ready with only minor wear (light scuffs, normal display handling). <b>Grade B</b> has noticeable cosmetic wear or missing non-critical items that are clearly disclosed. Full definitions are on the <a href="/trust">Trust &amp; safety</a> page.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Are returns allowed?</b></summary>
    <p>After the buyer accepts at pickup, the sale is final. Items are sold as-is.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>What disputes are allowed?</b></summary>
    <p>Disputes are limited to <b>material misrepresentation</b> (e.g., incorrect model, undisclosed major damage, missing critical components when the listing said “complete”). Normal wear consistent with the grade is not dispute-eligible.</p>
  </details>

<section class="panel">
  <h2>Using this with leadership / compliance</h2>
  <details open>
    <summary><b>How do we summarize results internally?</b></summary>
    <p>Completed sales can be summarized by count, gross sales volume, average sale price, and dispute count. This is designed to be easily forwardable to leadership.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Does this change showroom warranty policy?</b></summary>
    <p>No. These are as-is sales of display/clearance items. Any manufacturer warranty policies remain unchanged and should be communicated consistently in the listing.</p>
  </details>
